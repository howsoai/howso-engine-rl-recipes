* * *

This page tracks the performance of user algorithms for various tasks in gym. Previously, users could submit their scores directly to [gym.openai.com/envs](https://gym.openai.com/envs/), but it has been decided that a simpler wiki might do this task more efficiently.

This wiki page is a community driven page. Anyone can edit this page and add to it. We encourage you to contribute and modify this page and add your scores and links to your write-ups and code to reproduce your results. We also encourage you to add new tasks with the gym interface, but not in the core gym library (such as roboschool) to this page as well.

Links to videos are optional, but encouraged. Videos can be youtube, instagram, a tweet, or other public links. Write-ups should explain how to reproduce the result, and can be in the form of a simple gist link, blog post, or github repo.

We have begun to copy over the previous performance scores and write-up links over from the [previous page](https://gym.openai.com/envs/). This is an ongoing effort, and we can use some help.

### CartPole-v0

[](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#cartpole-v0)
![Image 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8510097/31701291-3b9f3d94-b384-11e7-8ee1-70fb1e7deb63.PNG) A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright. The episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center.

*   [Environment Details](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0)

*   _CartPole-v0 defines "solving" as getting average reward of 195.0 over 100 consecutive trials._

*   _This environment corresponds to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson [Barto83]._

![Image 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8510097/31701297-3ebf291c-b384-11e7-8289-24f1d392fb48.PNG) A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.

*   [Environment details](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/MountainCar-v0)
*   _MountainCar-v0 defines "solving" as getting average reward of -110.0 over 100 consecutive trials._

The acrobot system includes two joints and two links, where the joint between the two links is actuated. Initially, the links are hanging downwards, and the goal is to swing the end of the lower link up to a given height.

*   _Acrobot-v1_ is an unsolved environment, which means it does not have a specified reward threshold at which it's considered solved.*
*   _Control of Acrobot around equilibrium was described by J. Hauser and R. Murray in ACC 1990. Swing-up control of Acrobot is in M. W. Spong, IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 1995._
*   _Learning control on Acrobot was first described by Sutton [Sutton96]. We are using the version from RLPy [Geramiford15], which uses Runge-Kutta integration for better accuracy._

Coordinates are the first two numbers in state vector. Reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad and zero speed is about 100..140 points. If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is +10. Firing main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Solved is 200 points. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. Four discrete actions available: do nothing, fire left orientation engine, fire main engine, fire right orientation engine.

Coordinates are the first two numbers in state vector. Reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad and zero speed is about 100..140 points. If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is +10. Firing main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Solved is 200 points. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. Action is two real values vector from -1 to +1. First controls main engine, -1..0 off, 0..+1 throttle from 50% to 100% power. Engine can't work with less than 50% power. Second value -1.0..-0.5 fire left engine, +0.5..+1.0 fire right engine, -0.5..0.5 off.

Discreet control is reasonable in this environment as well, on/off discretisation is fine. State consists of 96x96 pixels. Reward is -0.1 every frame and +1000/N for every track tile visited, where N is the total number of tiles in track. For example, if you have finished in 732 frames, your reward is 1000 - 0.1*732 = 926.8 points. Episode finishes when all tiles are visited. Some indicators shown at the bottom of the window and the state RGB buffer. From left to right: true speed, four ABS sensors, steering wheel position, gyroscope.

(*) They used reward shaping (added some score back when the agent dies) during training to make training work better, but unfortunately kept the artificial shaped score for evaluation. When testing their agent using their model (and also trying to train it from scratch, which performed worse), we got a score of 820. We have filed an [issue](https://github.com/Rafael1s/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Udacity/issues/3). We found a similar problem with another PPO repo [here](https://github.com/xtma/pytorch_car_caring/issues/2).

The swimmer consist of three segments ('links') and two articulation joints (’rotors’) - one rotor joint connecting exactly two links to form a linear chain. The swimmer is suspended in a two dimensional pool, and the goal is to move as fast as possible towards the right by applying torque on the rotors and using the fluids friction.

This environment adapts a game from the [PyGame Learning Environment](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (PLE). To run it, you will need to install gym-ple from [https://github.com/lusob/gym-ple](https://github.com/lusob/gym-ple).

Flappybird is a side-scrolling game where the agent must successfully navigate through gaps between pipes. The up arrow causes the bird to accelerate upwards. If the bird makes contact with the ground or pipes, or goes above the top of the screen, the game is over. For each pipe it passes through it gains a positive reward of +1. Each time a terminal state is reached it receives a negative reward of -1.

*   _FlappyBird-v0 is an unsolved environment, which means it does not have a specified reward threshold at which it's considered solved._

[](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#snake-v0)
Snake is a game where the agent must maneuver a line which grows in length each time food is touched by the head of the segment. The line follows the previous paths taken which eventually become obstacles for the agent to avoid.

The food is randomly spawned inside of the valid window while checking it does not make contact with the snake body.

### Taxi-v2

[](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#taxi-v2)
This task was introduced in [Dietterich2000] to illustrate some issues in hierarchical reinforcement learning. There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters) and your job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off in another. You receive +20 points for a successful dropoff, and lose 1 point for every timestep it takes. There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions.

### Taxi-v3

[](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#taxi-v3)
This task was introduced in [Dietterich2000] to illustrate some issues in hierarchical reinforcement learning. There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters) and your job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off in another. You receive +20 points for a successful dropoff, and lose 1 point for every timestep it takes. There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions.

### GuessingGame-V0

[](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#guessinggame-v0)
The goal of the game is to guess within 1% of the randomly chosen number within 200 time steps

After each step the agent is provided with one of four possible observations which indicate where the guess is in relation to the randomly chosen number

### FrozenLake-v0

[](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#frozenlake-v0)
The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.
